Cheaters!
Jaime Tan Leon and Carlos Villapudua

I. Program Description
----------------------
The program will find similarities between files and detect possible sources of plagiarism

II. File list
------------
makefile
main.cpp
directory.cpp
directory.h
hashTable.cpp
hashTable.h
README.txt	Instructions and comments on the program

III. How to run the driver:
--------------------------
After you unzip the file, you will have 7 files in which you will need 6 of them in order to run the program.

You need the file to be in the same directory. While in Kamek, you use the command "make" without the quotes.
This will create an executable file named cheater.

You can type the following command line (requires the executable name):

  ./cheater path/to/directory (word size of chunk) (minimum amount of similarities)

The program will output the number of similarities separated by a colon and then followed by the two files that have that many similarities.
